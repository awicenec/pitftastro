# Development Notes

  - The pitftastro.service file needs work.
  - The correct device file for the touchscreen should be autodetected, not hardcoded in libs/pitfttouchscreen
  - the current 'plugin' architecture for apps is not really clean, since it requires additional files in libs and has some stuff hardcoded in the main program.
  - most of the available apps should be removed, but we keep them for now as examples.
  - The way the settings are working could probably be improved as well.
